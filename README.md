# shared-bike
This is the project sharing ride, learning it will make you more familiar with linux

(including the implementation of a highly concurrent server and Qt user interface under Linux), using a single instance [event distributor] and publish-and-subscribe mode [correspondence between request types and request processing], packetization and sticky packet processing using a wrapper header solution, using protocbuf to implement the application layer protocol, libevent to handle network links, makefile to compile the project

The Linux part of the high concurrency server has been completed, and the Qt part is in progress......
